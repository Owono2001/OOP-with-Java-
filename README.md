For the Object-Oriented Programming with Java assignment, our team developed a Car Rental System using Java and NetBeans. The system features two main users: the Administrator and the Customer, each interacting with the system through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The application allows for streamlined car rental transactions while ensuring that both user roles can perform their tasks efficiently.

Key Features:
Administrator:

Can create and manage new administrators.
Add, modify, and delete cars available for rental.
Generate reports regarding system performance, earnings, and customer usage.
Modify customer information such as email or contact number.
Track and manage customer rentals, including confirming returns and cancellations.
Search for customer histories and bookings.
Customer:

Can create an account and log in to view available cars.
Book cars by selecting the desired model and rental duration.
View upcoming and past bookings.
The project applied key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Aggregation, and Composition to manage data flow between different classes, including Car, Customer, Booking, and FileOperations. The application reads and writes to text files to store data persistently, with separate files for users, cars, and bookings.

Pedro Fabian Owono Ondo Mangue was responsible for developing the Admin and Customer login and registration sections of the application, ensuring secure access to the system for both user roles. Lam Weng Yew worked on the Customer booking pages and Admin functionalities, handling car management and booking status updates.
